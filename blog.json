    "body": "This site started as a bare repo and turned into a honeydew-themed playground.\n\nWhat we added so far:\n- A Bootstrap-powered layout with sections for projects, links, and a JSON-backed blog.\n- A Three.js hero scene where low-poly solids fall and roll \"downhill\" behind the content, with cursor pushback, lighting, grain, and adjustable motion blur.\n- A floating control panel that lets you tweak how many shapes are on screen and how fast they move, plus a manual light/dark theme toggle.\n- A live status bar at the bottom of the hero that pulls fresh headlines from r/collapse, truncates them, and links out to the original threads.\n\nThe plan is to keep treating this as a tiny lab: ship weird ideas, wire up odd data sources, and let the UI drift toward whatever feels interesting next."
